# Assorted lab projects
Some work done in the lab

1) Cryo-electron microscopy data analysis; determine which squares on a grid had good particles in them:<br>
    -- Good particles = those that contributed to the final structure reconstruction.<br>

2) Manipulate protein sequence (switch between different sequence formats; mutate a residue based on position):<br>
    -- Change between 1-letter and 3-letter codes for amino acid sequences;<br>
    -- Mutate an amino acid at a specified position in the protein sequence.<br>

3) Process Excel data on equipment use (user, duration, price) - write out an Excel file:<br>
    -- Output = Excel sheet with analysed / processed data.<br>

4) Process emails that contain information about recent purchases - write out an Excel file:<br>
    -- Extract key details about each purchase, to be stored in a master Excel spreadsheet;<br>
    -- Output = Excel sheet with processed data.
